Exercise 30: Pick word
2 chilis

This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The
other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.

In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a
random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary.
Download this file and save it in the same directory as your
Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the
dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments.
Each line in the file contains a single word.

Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.

One of Michele's samples has
words = list(word_file)
which is pretty sweet, but it doesn't strip out the /n

and random_word_index could be one line instead of 2

import random

if __name__ == '__main__':
    word_list = []
    with open('sowpods.txt', 'r') as word_file:
        word = word_file.readline().strip()
        while word:
            word_list.append(word)
            word = word_file.readline().strip()

    random_word_index = random.randint(0, len(word_list))
    print('random word is ' + word_list[random_word_index])
