# practicepython.org-mysolutions
These are my solutions to the exercises posted on practicepython.org.
These solutions are not meant to be the best or most straightforward or stupendous in any way; I
did them as a way to learn some python.
Putting them here seemed like a good way to learn a bit about git.
